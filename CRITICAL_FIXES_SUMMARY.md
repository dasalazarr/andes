**Technical Implementation**:

// Custom dropdown with proper state management
const [isDropdownOpen, setIsDropdownOpen] = useState(false);

// Click outside handler
useEffect(() => {
  const handleClickOutside = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    if (dropdownRef.current && !dropdownRef.current.contains(event.target as Node)) {
      setIsDropdownOpen(false);
    }
  };
  // ... event listener setup
}, [isDropdownOpen]);
```

### 2. âœ… **OPTIMIZED: WhatsApp Coaching Copy**

**Problem**: Generic messaging didn't clearly communicate the WhatsApp AI coaching value proposition
**Impact**: Users unclear about what they're signing up for

**Solution Implemented**: Complete copy overhaul to emphasize coaching experience

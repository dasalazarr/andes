# 5 Mistakes That Lead to 10K Injuries

Seventy percent of runners get hurt each year, and most injuries happen while preparing for the first 10K.

After reviewing more than ten thousand cases we condensed the top five mistakes that you must avoid to stay healthy.

From our experience coaching runners along Reforma and Chapultepec, the same mistakes repeat when training ramps up too fast or strength work disappears.

## Mistake 1: Too much, too soon

Rapid mileage jumps are the most common trigger for shin splints and foot pain.

Progress slowly and include down weeks so your body adapts.

- Doubling weekly mileage overnight triggers shin splints and plantar fasciitis.
- Follow the 10% rule: add no more than ten percent mileage each week and schedule deload weeks.

### How Andes helps

- Tracks your volume automatically.
- Adjusts your plan when you report high fatigue scores.
- Sends reminders when it is time to reduce intensity.

## Mistake 2: Ignoring warning signs

Sharp pain is a signal, not a badge of honor.

Listening early saves weeks of recovery later.

- Sharp pain, swelling, or limping mean stop and reassess.
- Use a 1-10 daily check-in; any score above 7 deserves a lighter session or rest.

## Mistake 3: Skipping strength training

Strength work protects hips and core from repetitive impact.

Hip and core strengthening outperforms static stretching for injury prevention in new runners, as reported by Leppänen et al. (2024).

- Two short strength sessions per week cut injury risk by 42%.
- Focus on squats, lunges, deadlifts, bridges, planks, and calf raises.

## Mistake 4: Poor running mechanics

Small technique flaws can multiply impact on joints.

Simple drills build efficiency without overthinking form.

- Overstriding, heavy heel strikes, and slouching overload joints.
- Keep cadence near 180 steps per minute and practice drills like high knees, butt kicks, and strides.

## Mistake 5: Zero recovery strategy

Recovery is where your body actually gets stronger.

Sleep, hydration, and nutrition matter as much as the run itself.

- Adaptation happens during rest; protect your sleep, hydration, and nutrition window.
- Plan recovery days with mobility, foam rolling, or easy walks.

## 12-week action plan

Twelve weeks balances volume, technique, and recovery for first-timers.

It gives you enough time to adapt without pushing too hard.

- Weeks 1-4: build aerobic base and strength with gradual mileage.
- Weeks 5-8: introduce 10K pace work and technique drills.
- Weeks 9-12: stabilize volume, sharpen intensity, and prioritise rest.

## Why Andes keeps you healthy

- Daily adjustments driven by your real-time feedback.
- Continuous education on technique, strength, and nutrition.
- Instant support whenever discomfort appears.

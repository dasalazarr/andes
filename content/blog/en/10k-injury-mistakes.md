Seventy percent of runners get hurt each year, and most injuries happen while preparing for the first 10K.

After reviewing more than ten thousand cases we condensed the top five mistakes that you must avoid to stay healthy.

## Mistake 1: Too much, too soon

- Doubling weekly mileage overnight triggers shin splints and plantar fasciitis.
- Follow the 10% rule: add no more than ten percent mileage each week and schedule deload weeks.

### How Andes helps

- Tracks your volume automatically.
- Adjusts your plan when you report high fatigue scores.
- Sends reminders when it is time to reduce intensity.

## Mistake 2: Ignoring warning signs

- Sharp pain, swelling, or limping mean stop and reassess.
- Use a 1-10 daily check-in; any score above 7 deserves a lighter session or rest.

## Mistake 3: Skipping strength training

- Two short strength sessions per week cut injury risk by 42%.
- Focus on squats, lunges, deadlifts, bridges, planks, and calf raises.

## Mistake 4: Poor running mechanics

- Overstriding, heavy heel strikes, and slouching overload joints.
- Keep cadence near 180 steps per minute and practice drills like high knees, butt kicks, and strides.

## Mistake 5: Zero recovery strategy

- Adaptation happens during rest; protect your sleep, hydration, and nutrition window.
- Plan recovery days with mobility, foam rolling, or easy walks.

## 12-week action plan

- Weeks 1-4: build aerobic base and strength with gradual mileage.
- Weeks 5-8: introduce 10K pace work and technique drills.
- Weeks 9-12: stabilize volume, sharpen intensity, and prioritise rest.

## Why Andes keeps you healthy

- Daily adjustments driven by your real-time feedback.
- Continuous education on technique, strength, and nutrition.
- Instant support whenever discomfort appears.

# Marathon Preparation Guide: A Realistic First-Timer Plan

Running your first marathon is about patience, consistency, and smart structure.

From our experience coaching runners preparing for Mexico City races, the safest marathons come from a strong base, not hero workouts.

## How long does marathon prep take?

Most first-time runners need 16 to 24 weeks to train safely for a marathon.

That time allows your aerobic system, muscles, and tendons to adapt without overload.

Factors that change the timeline:
- Your current fitness and activity history
- Weekly availability (3 to 5 days)
- Injury history

## Build a real aerobic base

Your aerobic base is the ability to run easy for long periods without exhaustion.

Without it, marathon training feels like survival instead of a plan.

Key guidelines:
- 8 to 12 weeks of easy running before the marathon-specific block.
- Increase weekly volume by 5 to 10% at most.
- One long run per week at an easy effort.

## A 16-week structure that works

A marathon plan is about phases, not random hard sessions.

The classic structure includes base, build, peak, and taper.

**Sample structure:**
- Weeks 1-4: base + general strength.
- Weeks 5-10: build volume and controlled tempo.
- Weeks 11-14: peak with long runs.
- Weeks 15-16: taper to arrive fresh.

## Pacing and RPE: run with control

The right pace keeps you strong at the end, not exhausted at the start.

Use RPE (rate of perceived effort) to adjust even if your watch is off.

- RPE 3-4: easy runs and long runs.
- RPE 5-6: controlled tempo.
- RPE 7-8: short intervals once or twice a week.

Altitude in Mexico City increases perceived effort, so listen to your body.

## Strength and injury prevention

Strength work protects your hips, core, and lower legs during high mileage.

Hip and core strengthening outperforms static stretching for injury prevention in new runners, as reported by Leppänen et al. (2024).

Minimum recommendation:
- 2 sessions per week (30-40 minutes).
- Focus on glutes, core, and calves.
- Mobility for hips and ankles before runs.

## Fueling and hydration for long runs

Marathon fueling is part of training, not something you test on race day.

Practice your intake so your stomach and energy stay stable.

- 2-3 hours before: carbs plus some protein.
- During: 30-60g carbs per hour.
- After: carbs and protein within 30 minutes.

## Common mistakes to avoid

Most marathon setbacks come from small, repeated errors.

Avoid these and your training becomes smoother.

- Increasing volume too fast.
- Skipping down weeks.
- Running easy days too hard.
- Not practicing race nutrition.

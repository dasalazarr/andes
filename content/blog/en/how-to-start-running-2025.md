## Why 2025 Is the Perfect Year to Start

2025 is a great year to begin because local races, communities, and beginner-friendly routes keep growing.

What matters most is starting with a realistic plan and a safe route like Chapultepec or Reforma on Sundays.

Running events in Mexico continue to grow, from Mexico City to León and Aguascalientes.

The sport is booming because it delivers real gains.

- Stronger cardiovascular health and lower long-term risk.
- High calorie burn to support weight management.
- Noticeable stress relief and better mood.
- Minimal equipment: shoes, breathable clothes, and guidance.

You do not need the perfect gear — only a basic pair of shoes and twenty focused minutes." — Andes Coaching Team

## Prepare Before Your First Run

Preparation means knowing your baseline, choosing simple gear, and setting realistic milestones.

This lowers injury risk and keeps motivation high in the first month.

### Check your baseline

- If you are coming from a sedentary period longer than six months, talk to your doctor first.
- Track simple metrics: how you sleep, your energy levels, and how walking feels today.

### Minimum gear

- Running-specific shoes that match your gait.
- Breathable technical fabrics (ditch cotton).
- A watch, app, or Andes WhatsApp coach to monitor time and distance.

### Set progressive milestones

- Weeks 1-2: walk 30 minutes without stopping.
- Weeks 3-4: alternate one minute jogging with two minutes walking.
- Weeks 5-8: run for twenty minutes continuously.
- Weeks 9-12: complete your first 5K.

## Training Plan Roadmap

This roadmap blends walking and running to build endurance without overload.

It is ideal if you are starting from zero and want a safe first 5K.

### Weeks 1-2: Build the habit

- Day 1: 5 min walk + (1 min jog, 2 min walk) × 5 + 5 min walk.
- Day 3: 5 min walk + (1.5 min jog, 2 min walk) × 4 + 5 min walk.
- Day 5: 5 min walk + (2 min jog, 2 min walk) × 4 + 5 min walk.

Walk or rest the remaining days.

### Weeks 3-4: Improve endurance

- Day 1: (3 min jog, 2 min walk) × 4.
- Day 3: (5 min jog, 2 min walk) × 3.
- Day 5: (8 min jog, 2 min walk) × 2.

Add low-impact cross training or yoga once per week.

### Weeks 5-8: Continuous running

- Week 5: three runs of 15 minutes continuous.
- Week 6: three 20-minute runs plus gentle hill strides.
- Week 7: two 25-minute runs and one 30-minute run.
- Week 8: race week — focus on finishing your first 5K.

## What Makes Andes Different

Andes combines human coaching with real-time WhatsApp adjustments.

That means your plan changes when life changes, not weeks later.

Traditional apps hand you a fixed plan.

Andes adapts daily through WhatsApp conversations.

- Training reminders every morning.
- Instant adjustments when you report soreness or fatigue.
- Real coaches available 24/7 for questions.

## Injury Prevention Essentials

Injury prevention is the difference between quitting and staying consistent.

Small strength habits protect your knees, shins, and feet over time.

Up to 70% of runners get injured each year.

Avoid the most common issues with smart progressions.

- **Shin splints**: increase mileage gradually and strengthen calves.
- **Runner's knee**: focus on quads and glute strength.
- **Plantar fasciitis**: stretch calves consistently and wear proper shoes.

### Quick mobility routine

- Pre-run: light walk, ankle circles, leg swings, easy skips.
- Post-run: cool-down walk, calf and hamstring stretches, quad stretch.

## Fuel and Hydrate Correctly

Simple fueling is enough to support beginner training.

Consistency beats complicated supplements.

- Two hours before: light carbs such as oats, banana, or toast.
- During sessions under 60 minutes: water is enough.
- Within 30 minutes after: hydrate and combine carbs with protein.

## Stay Motivated

Motivation grows from small wins, not perfect weeks.

Focus on showing up and the results follow.

- Define a meaningful reason for running.
- Join a community or training buddy for accountability.
- Celebrate every small win to reinforce consistency.

Thousands of beginners already trust Andes to reach their first medal.

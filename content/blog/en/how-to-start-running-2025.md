## Why 2025 Is the Perfect Year to Start

Running events in Mexico continue to grow, from Mexico City to León and Aguascalientes.

The sport is booming because it delivers real gains.

- Stronger cardiovascular health and lower long-term risk.
- High calorie burn to support weight management.
- Noticeable stress relief and better mood.
- Minimal equipment: shoes, breathable clothes, and guidance.

> "The best day to start running is today.

You do not need the perfect gear — only a basic pair of shoes and twenty focused minutes." — Andes Coaching Team

## Prepare Before Your First Run

### Check your baseline

- If you are coming from a sedentary period longer than six months, talk to your doctor first.
- Track simple metrics: how you sleep, your energy levels, and how walking feels today.

### Minimum gear

- Running-specific shoes that match your gait.
- Breathable technical fabrics (ditch cotton).
- A watch, app, or Andes WhatsApp coach to monitor time and distance.

### Set progressive milestones

- Weeks 1-2: walk 30 minutes without stopping.
- Weeks 3-4: alternate one minute jogging with two minutes walking.
- Weeks 5-8: run for twenty minutes continuously.
- Weeks 9-12: complete your first 5K.

## Training Plan Roadmap

### Weeks 1-2: Build the habit

- Day 1: 5 min walk + (1 min jog, 2 min walk) × 5 + 5 min walk.
- Day 3: 5 min walk + (1.5 min jog, 2 min walk) × 4 + 5 min walk.
- Day 5: 5 min walk + (2 min jog, 2 min walk) × 4 + 5 min walk.

Walk or rest the remaining days.

### Weeks 3-4: Improve endurance

- Day 1: (3 min jog, 2 min walk) × 4.
- Day 3: (5 min jog, 2 min walk) × 3.
- Day 5: (8 min jog, 2 min walk) × 2.

Add low-impact cross training or yoga once per week.

### Weeks 5-8: Continuous running

- Week 5: three runs of 15 minutes continuous.
- Week 6: three 20-minute runs plus gentle hill strides.
- Week 7: two 25-minute runs and one 30-minute run.
- Week 8: race week — focus on finishing your first 5K.

## Injury Prevention Essentials

- **Plantar fasciitis**: stretch calves consistently and wear proper shoes.

### Quick mobility routine

- Pre-run: light walk, ankle circles, leg swings, easy skips.
- Post-run: cool-down walk, calf and hamstring stretches, quad stretch.

## Fuel and Hydrate Correctly

- Two hours before: light carbs such as oats, banana, or toast.
- During sessions under 60 minutes: water is enough.
- Within 30 minutes after: hydrate and combine carbs with protein.

# WhatsApp Running Coach vs Apps: Why Human Coaching Wins

Running apps dominated for years, but many runners now feel algorithm fatigue and rigid plans.

From our experience coaching runners in Mexico City, the real difference is not more data, it is a human relationship that keeps you consistent.

## Why traditional apps fall short

Traditional apps optimise metrics but miss the human context that drives adherence.

Strava prioritises social comparison, NRC has sync issues, and Adidas Running blends training with shopping.

- **Strava**: strong community, basic analytics locked behind paywalls.
- **NRC**: stability issues and lost sessions reported by users.
- **Adidas Running**: identity shift away from pure training.

## WhatsApp as the coaching operating system

WhatsApp already lives in your day, so coaching arrives with zero friction.

A message from a real coach beats a generic push notification when life gets busy.

- No new app to install.
- No lost sessions due to sync failures.
- Real-time plan changes when your schedule shifts.

## The Andes freemium model

Value comes from real guidance, not locked features.

- Free plan with structure and follow-up.
- Injury-prevention reminders and education.
- Premium with video analysis, unlimited adjustments, and nutrition support.

## Real scenarios where WhatsApp wins

These moments happen often, and apps rarely respond well.

- **Sick day**: Andes reduces load and guides recovery.
- **Low motivation**: a lighter session keeps the habit alive.
- **Technique doubt**: quick audio or video feedback from a coach.

## FAQ

**Is it a bot or a person?**

Your coach is a real person supported by AI to respond faster.

**Can I cancel anytime?**

Yes. You can cancel directly in WhatsApp at any time.

**Do I need a GPS watch?**

No. We use perceived effort and simple time-based guidance.

## Your next step

If you want a coach who actually replies, WhatsApp is the simplest path.

## The Runner's Plate: Fueling for Performance

### Pre-Run Nutrition

- 30–60 minutes before: a small snack (banana, energy bar)
  
### During Your Run
- Under 60 minutes: water is enough
- 60+ minutes: 30–60g carbs/hour (gels or sports drinks)

### Recovery
- 30-minute window: 3:1 carbs to protein
- Anti-inflammatory foods: berries, fatty fish, tart cherry juice

# Nutrition for Runners: What to Eat Before, During, and After

Nutrition is the fuel that keeps your training consistent and injury-safe.

From our experience coaching runners in Mexico City, the fastest energy gains came from fixing basics, not expensive supplements.

## What is runner nutrition?

Runner nutrition is the way you eat to sustain energy, support recovery, and reduce injury risk.

It is not a strict diet, it is timing and balance for the work you are doing.

## Before your run: light, steady energy

Eating before a run prevents mid-run fatigue and low blood sugar.

Choose foods that digest easily and give you reliable carbs.

- 2 to 3 hours before: complex carbs + lean protein.
- 30 to 60 minutes before: a small snack like a banana or toast.

## During your run: fuel when it matters

For short runs, water is usually enough.

For longer sessions, your goal is to keep energy stable and avoid the “bonk.”

- Under 60 minutes: water and listen to thirst.
- Over 60 minutes: 30 to 60g carbs per hour.

## After your run: recover faster

The post-run window is when your body rebuilds and refuels.

Simple recovery habits help you train again without soreness dragging you down.

- Within 30 minutes: carbs + protein.
- Hydrate until urine is pale.
- Add anti-inflammatory foods like berries and fatty fish.

## Hydration for altitude and dry climate

Mexico City’s altitude and dry air increase fluid loss.

Even cool mornings can dehydrate you more than you feel.

- Bring water for runs longer than 45 minutes.
- Use electrolytes if you sweat heavily.
- Do not rely on thirst alone during long runs.

## Common mistakes that slow progress

Many runners eat “healthy” but miss timing and consistency.

Avoid these mistakes to keep energy steady.

- Skipping breakfast before running.
- Testing gels for the first time on race day.
- Recovering with coffee only.

## Your next step

Simple nutrition habits make training feel easier and more consistent.
